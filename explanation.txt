====Overview of algorithm====




====Known issues and concerns====

* Relies on geoip to find closest cache
	- Geoip doesn't always work
	- Closest cache isn't necessarily the best cache
	- No checking for "next-closest" cache if closest cache is temporarily down and status is not yet reflected in caches.json
	
* Call could be simpler, without requiring the use of flags for every argument
	- Want: stashcp <FILE> <LOCATION> <FLAGS>
	- Have: stashcp -s <FILE> -l <LOCATION> <FLAGS>
	
* Static hard-coded number of attempts to pull from cache (2) and trunk (1)
	- Does not take type of error/failure into account
	- If the closest cache is the trunk, then the algorithm will attempt to pull from the trunk 3 times, instead of 1 or 2
	
* Relies explicitly on the trunk being up in order to run critical steps
	- In particular, relies on trunk being up in order to get size of file or to get contents of directory
	- Could lead to unnecessary failure when the trunk is down but files are already present and accounted for on closest cache

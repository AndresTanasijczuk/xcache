====Overview of algorithm====


====Known bugs and problems====

- Relies on geoip to find closest cache
  - Geoip doesn't always work
  - Closest cache isn't necessarily the best cache
- Call could be simpler, without requiring the use of flags for every argument
  - Wanted: stashcp <FILE> <LOCATION> <FLAGS>
  - Have: stashcp -s <FILE> -l <LOCATION> <FLAGS>
-

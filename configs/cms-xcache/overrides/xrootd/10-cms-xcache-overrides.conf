# Service dependencies:
# - Make sure the authfile is generated before startup, but make it a softer
#   dependency: we want to allow Xrootd to restart even if the topology service
#   is down.
# - Depends on fetch-crl and the reporter script, but doesn't need these
#   to finish or succeed for startup.
